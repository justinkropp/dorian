<p>I’ve been re-reading Norman Potter’s eloquent <a href="http://amzn.to/2BGFDDf">What Is a Designer</a>. There are a handful of books that I revisit periodically to both refresh my perspective on and rekindle the relationship with my discipline — graphic design.</p>

<h2>On good design:</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>For the designer, good design is the generous and pertinent response to the full context of a design opportunity, whether large or small, and the quality of the outcome resides in a close and truthful correspondence between form and meaning. The meaning of a good garden spade is seen in its behavior, that it performs well; in its look and feel, its strength and required durability; in a directness of address through the simple expression of its function.</p>
