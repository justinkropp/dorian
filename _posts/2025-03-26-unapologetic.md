<p>Talking politics or religion is often considered taboo — especially in unfamiliar social settings — for fear of insulting the beliefs or worldviews of others. Treading lightly is overrated, and I say fuck holding your views close to the chest. Many political positions — and all religious views — are contemptible and worthy of savage derision. If you hold your convictions firm, and believe them to be on the right side of morality, then be unapologetic in both your holding of those convictions and in your freedom to publicly espouse them. The world needs fewer milksops, not more.</p>

<p>I’m a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_humanism">secular humanist</a> with progressive views living in the heart of the bible belt — as I have much of my adult life. It is a region of our country that is largely unlettered and wholly delusional. While living here can be challenging at times, it’s largely tolerable if you disregard the willful ignorance, apathy toward intellectual curiosity, and rampant bigotry that abounds. Easier said that done, for sure.</p>

<p>I’ve lost relationships and friendships due to my beliefs, but I stay steadfast in and true to those beliefs and walk through life utterly unapologetic for holding them. To do otherwise would be a betrayal of the values I claim to hold. </p>
