<p>“Opinions are like assholes; everyone’s got one.”</p>

<p>This old adage has been around for quite a while and comes in many different flavors (pardon the visual). While everyone is entitled to <em>have</em> an opinion, you don’t <em>need</em> to.</p>

<p>Here’s where I land <em>ye old position</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you’re going to have an opinion, understand <em>why</em> you hold it and be able to <em>defend</em> it.</li>
<li>You <strong>do not</strong> have to have an opinion. In fact, I’d argue that holding no opinion should be your default.</li>
<li>Hold yours closely until asked for. <em>Think more. Talk less</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve found it to be quite liberating, when asked for my opinion on a particular matter, to state that I have none.</p>

<p>Note: I understand the irony in having and volunteering an opinion on not having an opinion. Go figure.</p>
