  <p>The <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/">rabbit r1</a> is marketed as a <em>pocket companion, powered by rabbit os — a personalized operating system through a natural language interface</em>.</p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>The rabbit r1 is a toy for <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">adult children</a> with excess disposable income and a paralyzing fear of missing out on the latest piece of tech; tech they need in order to keep up with the Joneses.</p>

<p>Rather than producing innovative tech of merit, they opted to manufacture problems that don’t need to be solved. Rabbit has clearly earned a top spot in this club along with the likes of <a href="https://humane.com/">Humane</a> and <a href="https://teenage.engineering/">teenage engineering</a>.</p>
