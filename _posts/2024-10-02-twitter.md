<article>
<p>I joined Twitter a few years ago with the intent of just flirting with the experience. I was curious about its user experience and the range of content it offered. My biggest question was whether or not it could provide enough value that would make it sticky.</p>

<p>It did not.</p>

<p>Even in the browsing of circles directly related to my own discipline, career, or interests it fell short. What I did find was brute posturing, ignorance masquerading as expertise, toxic positivity, unlettered assertions, thought-terminating clichés, and — in the case of almighty tech — an exercise in mutual masturbation disguised as LFG tropes.</p> 

<p>No thanks. I’ll stick with books and reticence.</p>
